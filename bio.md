Xin chào! I am a Research Scientist and a Seninor Member at [Preferred.AI](https://preferred.ai/). I completed my PhD at [SMU School of Computing and Information Systems](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Hady W. Lauw](http://www.hadylauw.com). My dissertation is on Recommendation Explanation, providing rationale for given recommendations. My research interests include web mining, recommender systems, and trustworthy artificial intelligence.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [KMS Technology](https://www.kms-technology.com/). Earlier, I completed my bachelor degree at [VNU-HCM University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/), during which I had a stint as Research Asistant at [VNU-HCM John von Neumann Institute](http://jvn.edu.vn/).

I am grateful of the following supportive scholarships that helped me afford my study: [SMU Full Scholarships](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/phd/admissions-fees-scholarships), [SMU Presidential Doctoral Fellowship](https://graduatestudies.smu.edu.sg/phd/singapore-management-university-smu-presidential-doctoral-fellowships), [2020 SDSC Dissertation Research Fellowship](https://sdsc.sg/?page_id=12274).
