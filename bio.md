I am a PhD candidate at [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Hady W. Lauw](http://www.hadylauw.com), and a member of [Preferred.AI](https://preferred.ai/) research group. I have received the [SMU Presidential Doctoral Fellowship](https://graduatestudies.smu.edu.sg/phd/singapore-management-university-smu-presidential-doctoral-fellowships). I was also fortunate to receive the [2020 SDSC Dissertation Research Fellowship](https://sdsc.sg/?page_id=12274). My research interests include web mining, search and recommendation, and digital signal processing.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [KMS Technology](https://www.kms-technology.com/). Earlier, I got my bachelor degree at [VNU-HCM University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/), during which I had a stint as Research Asistant at [VNU-HCM John von Neumann Institute](http://jvn.edu.vn/).
