I am currently a Software Engineer in the KMS Technology Vietnam.

Before joining KMS Technology, I was a student at [Advanced Program in Computer Science](http://www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/Default.aspx?alias=www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/en) of [VNU-HCM University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/).

During my third year, I worked as Research Asistant at [VNU-HCM John von Neumann Institute](http://www.jvn.edu.vn/).
