Xin chào! I am a Lecturer at [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/), University of Science, VNU-HCM, under the prestigious [VNU350 Project](https://vnu350.vnuhcm.edu.vn/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow at [Air Traffic Management Research Institute](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/atmri), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

My dissertation is on Recommendation Explanation, providing rationale for given recommendations.
