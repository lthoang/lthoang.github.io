I am a PhD candidate in the [SMU School of Information Systems](https://sis.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Hady W. Lauw](http://www.hadylauw.com). My research interests include natural language processing, digital signal processing, and machine learning.

Before joining SMU, I was a Software Engineer in [KMS Technology Vietnam](https://www.kms-technology.com/). Earlier, I got my bachelor at [Advanced Program in Computer Science](http://www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/Default.aspx?alias=www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/en) of [VNU-HCM University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/), during which I had a stint as Research Asistant at [VNU-HCM John von Neumann Institute](http://jvn.edu.vn/).
